Test your mouse precision skills with this simple maze game.


### todo
- Improve performance; perhaps prerender background and corridor and only draw ball new every frame. See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elm-discuss/1aTCesND8yM
- Catch right mouse click to avoid cheating. Does it actually help?
- "Looks like the mouse input is being handled after render but before display. updating the mouse position before the render would reduce the perceived lag in the ball that follows the mouse." - http://www.reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/1th5py/maze_test_your_mouse_precision_skills_with_this/ce7yn7c
